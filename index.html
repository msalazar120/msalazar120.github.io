        <p>Hello, My name is Marcos Salazar. I was born in the year 1997 and I am a part time employee and a part time student.
            Up until the end of the year 2021, I was a full time employee working as an office clerk. Not having more than 40 
            hour work weeks, I spent my free time on various activities. Now, I am taking a few online classes to further my skillset 
            but have noticed that I have a little less time to spend on the several hobbies that I slowly grew to like. You can click 
            on the <a href="https://www.sidmartinbio.org/what-major-events-happened-in-1997-in-the-united-states/">1997</a> to see what 
            major events happened on the year I was born.</p>
        
        <p>Although the online classes are cannibalizing a good portion of my free time, I am enjoying what I am learning and I 
            hope that my new skillset will help me improve my future career and maybe even my overall self. I hope to make coding 
            another one of my core hobbies by the end of this course. Some of the other hobbies that I enjoy include stuff like 
            collecting and watching 4k blurays, cycling, cooking, listening to music, working out,among other things.</p>
